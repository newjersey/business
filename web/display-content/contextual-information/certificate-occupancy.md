## Certificate of Occupancy

A Certificate of Occupancy (CO) indicates if a **building** is safe for occupancy AND indicates it's allowable use. A CO is required if you renovated a building, or if there was a change in use (for example, before the building was for manufacturing and now it's a commercial space).


## Certificate of Approval

A Certificate of Approval (CA) indicates if a **rented unit within a building** is safe for occupancy and indicates it's allowable use. A CA is required if your unit was renovated, or if there was a change in use (for example, before the unit was used as a nail salon and now it is a restaurant).
