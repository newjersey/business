## ADA Compliant Property

Depending on the specific site and your renovation plans, you may need to make accessibility upgrades from widening aisles to changing bathroom fixtures. Ask your landlord if the space is ADA compliant and discuss who will be responsible for any costs that are associated with accessibility upgrades and/or litigation should a lawsuit be filed. You may also consider having a Certified Access Specialist (CAS) to inspect the property and identify what changes are necessary to make the property ADA compliant.
