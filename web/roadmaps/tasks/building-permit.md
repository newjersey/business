Now that you signed your lease and determined site requirements, it's time to obtain permits that allow you to build or renovate your site. Not all businesses may need to complete these tasks, it varies by city and town, but if you're making changes to the use and layout of the site, your local government may require one if not all of the following:
      
1. **Site Drawings:** Hire an architect to create site drawings.
2. **Utilities:** Work with your local government on any utility or water approvals you may need.
3. **Construction Permits:** File for a construction permit with your government's local Building/Construction Department.
4. **Contractors:** Hire any contractors you may need such aplumbers, electrical, fire and/or HVAC. Remember that it's recommended that you get three quotes for every industry you want to hire.
5. **Start Construction!** Now that you have all the necessary approvals, drawings and contractors in place, it's time to build or renovate your site.
