Now that you signed your lease and determined site requirements, it's time to obtain permits that allow you to change the use of your site, or do renovations. Not all businesses may need to complete these tasks, it varies by city and town, but if you're making changes to the use and layout of the site, your local government may require one if not all of the following:
      
1. **Zoning Permits/Approval:** If you changed the use of your site, make sure to obtain approval from your local Zoning Office.
2. **Sign Permits:** Obtain signage approvals from your local Building Department, Department of Community Affairs, or Zoning Office.
3. **Construction Permits:** Prepare your site plans with an architect, get your building/construction permit with your local government's Building Department and then renovate your space.

After you complete this task, you will have:
- Zoning approval
- Sign permits
- - Consutrction permits/site build out
