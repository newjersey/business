Now that you signed your lease, and renovated your site, it's time to obtain approvals that show that your site is safe for customers and workers. The New Jersey Department of Consumer Affairs requires you to obtain and show a fire permit and Certificate of Occupancy or Approval prior to applying for a shop license. Below is a checklist with some of the certificates or permits you may need.
      
1. **Fire Prevent Permits:** Obtain any fire prevention or burglar alarm permits from your local Fire Department. ***This is required by the Department of Consumer Affairs to recieve a shop license.
2. **Certificate of Occupancy/Approval:** If you've completed site construction/renovations, it's time to obtain a `Certificate of Occupancy or Approval|certificate-occupancy` from your local Buildings/Construction Department. ***Remember, to apply for your shop license, you will need to submit this Certificate to the Department of Consumer Affairs.

After you complete this task, you will have:
- Fire prevention permits 
- Certificate of Occupancy or Approval
