Now that you signed your lease and determined site requirements, you may seek zoning and sign permits. 

Not all business need zoning or sign permits. If you are changing the use of your site, for example if the site was previosuly a pork roll manufacturer and is now a pizza place you may need to get zoning approval. Similarly, if you're changing the size or location of your street sign, you may need local govenrment approval. It's time to get:
      
1. **Zoning Permits/Approval:** Obtain zoning approval from your local Zoning Office.
2. **Sign Permits:** Obtain signage approvals from your local Building Department, Department of Community Affairs, or Zoning Office.

After you complete this task, you will have:
- Zoning approval
- Sign permits
