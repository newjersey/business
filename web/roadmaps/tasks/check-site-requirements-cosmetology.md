The New Jersey Department of Consumer Affairs requires you to obtain and show a fire permit or Certificate of Occupancy or Approval prior to applying for a shop license. You will need to obtain the fire permit and Certificate from your local government. To prevent any unexpected delays, speak to your local government now to understand their expectations and timeline for review and approval. Below are a few additional requirements to consider:
        
1. **Fire Prevention Permits:** Talk to your Fire Prevention Bureau or Fire Department to make sure your space is meeting requirements, like working sprinklers, extinguishers and signage). **_This is required by the Department of Consumer Affairs to recieve a shop license_**
2. **Store Signage:** Speak to your local Zoning Office to make sure the signage your proposing is permitted, and the Buildings/Consutruction Department for the construction and build out of the sign.
3. **Construction Permits:** Check if you need a building/construction permit with your local government's Building Department before starting any renovations. [Find out if you need a construction permit](https://business.nj.gov/pages/building-permits-and-inspections).
4. **Certificate of Occupancy/Approval:** If you need a construction permit for your renovation, you may need to meet with the Buildings/Construction Department to obtain a `Certificate of Occupancy or Approval|certificate-occupancy` that indicates that your space is safe for occupancy. **_This is required by the Department of Consumer Affairs to recieve a shop license_**
       
After you complete this task, you will know:
- what permits your local government requires
- what you need to do to meet those requirements 
- how long it will take to get any permits or certificates
