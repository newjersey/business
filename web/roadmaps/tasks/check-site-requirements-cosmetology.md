The New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs requires you to obtain and show a fire permit and Certificate of Occupancy or Approval prior to applying for a shop license. You will need to obtain the fire permit and Certificate from your local government. To prevent any unexpected delays, speak to your local government now to understand their expectations and timeline for review and approval. Below are additional information and permits to consider obtaining:
        
1. **Fire Prevention Permits:** Talk to your Fire Department to make sure your space is meeting requirements, like working sprinklers, extinguishers and signage). ***This is required by the Department of Consumer Affairs to recieve a shop license.***
