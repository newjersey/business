If you've decided on the your shop's location, now is a good time to check what requirements your local government has. We recommend you do this at the outset because it may result in delays and unneessary costs if done later. You will need a fire permit and Certificate of Occupancy or Approval for your shop license with the Department of Consumer of Affairs. Speak with your local government to understand the requirements and expetations around:
        
1) **Fire Prevention Permits:** Talk to your Fire Prevention Bureau or Fire Department to make sure you know their requirements and timeline for approval. When you apply for your shop license with the Department of Consumer Affairs, they will require this.
2) **Store Signage:** Speak to your local Zoning Office to make sure the signage your proposing is permitted, and the Buildings/Consutruction Department for the construction and build out of the sign.
3) **`Construction Permits:|construction-permits`** Check if you need a building permit with your local government's Building Department before starting any renovations. If you want to know more about your Building/Construction Department safety requirements, read through the [Uniform Construction Code](https://nj.gov/dca/divisions/codes/codreg/ucc.html).
4) **`Certificate of Occupancy/Approval:|certificate-occupancy`** If you needed a construction permit for your renovation, you may need to meet with the  Buildings/Construction Department to obtain a Certificate that indicates that your space is safe for occupancy.
