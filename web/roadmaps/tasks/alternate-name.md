You may decide to get an alternate business name(s). Some businesses do this if they want to have different business names under the same legal structure. If you decide to have an alternate name, it must be registered with the New Jersey Division of Revenue.

To complete this task, you must have:
- Entity ID
- Desired alternate name

After you complete this task, you will have:
- Registered alternate name
