Now that you've registered your business, you can sign your lease under your official business name and legal structure. Signing your lease under your registered business name protects you personally from liablities and costs associated with your new commerical or industrial location. 

Make sure your lease terms take into account:

1) `**The time it will take to get your business up and running**|lease-start` 
2) `**The length of the lease and other terms**|lease-considerations`
3) `**The party responsible for tenant improvements**|tenant-improvements`
        
To complete this step, you must have:
- Business name
- Legal structure
