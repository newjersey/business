Now that you signed your lease, and determined site requirements, it's time to obtain approvals that show that your site is safe for visitors. Below is a checklist with some of the certificates or permits you may need.
      
1. **Zoning Permits/Approval:** If you changed the use of your site, make sure to obtain approval from your local Zoning Office.
2. **Fire Prevent Permits:** Obtain any fire prevention or burglar alarm permits from your local Fire Department. _**This is required by the Department of Consumer Affairs to recieve a shop license.**
3. **Sign Permits:** Obtain signage approvals from your local Building/Construction Department, Department of Community Affairs, or Zoning Office.
4. **Certificate of Occupancy/Approval:** If you've completed site construction/renovations, it's time to obtain a `Certificate of Occupancy or Approval|certificate-occupancy` from your local Buildings/Construction Department. _**Remember, to apply for your shop license, you will need to submit this Certificate to the Department of Consumer Affairs.

After you complete this step, you will have:
- Zoning approval (if applicable)
- Fire prevention and/or sign permits (if applicable)
- Certificate of Occupancy or Approval
