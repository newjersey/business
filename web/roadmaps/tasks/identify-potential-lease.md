Finding a great location for your business is a critical step to set your business up for success. When you look for a lease, you may want to consider:

- **Location:** Consider locating your business where it can most effectively reach and serve your target customer base. There are several online tools, such as [PolicyMap](https://www.policymap.com/) and [Living Atlas](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/home/) that you can use to conduct a demographic analysis to help you identify the best neighborhood to reach your target market.

- **Tenant Improvements:** Most spaces will require some rennovation to meet your business needs. You may be able to negotiate Tenant Improvements (or "TIs") with your landlord. Tenant Improvements can take the form of an allowance to help make improvements to the space, free rent, or the landlord may agree to make the changes themselves.

- **ADA Compliance:** Commercial spaces are required to be accessible to people with disabilities ("ADA compliant"). Ask your landlord if the space is `ADA compliant|business-plan-resources`
 and discuss who will be responsible for any costs that are associated with accessibility upgrades and/or litigation should a lawsuit be filed. You may also consider having a Certified Access Specialist (CAS) to inspect the property and identify what changes are necessary to make the property ADA compliant.
