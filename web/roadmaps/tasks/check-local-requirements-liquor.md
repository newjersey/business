Now that you confirmed liquor license availability, completed step 3, and signed your lease, it's time to obtain your liquor license and any local permits or certificates. Below is a list of items to work with your local Clerk's office on.

1. **Liquor License:** Obtain your liquor license.
2. **Mercantile License:** Check if you need a mercantile license. Some cities and towns require this, it helps municipalities track businesses in the area.
3. **Additional actions for your industry:** Depending on the type of business you open, your town may require industry specific permits/licencing (e.g. Food Vendors and Gas Stations require licenses in Cherry Hill).

After you complete this task, you will have:
- A liquor license
- Obtained all necessary local permits or licenses.
