If you've decided on the your shop's location, now is a good time to check your local government's requirements and approval timelines. We recommend you do this at the outset because it may result in delays and unneessary costs if done later. Below are common items you may need local government approval for:
        
1. **Fire Prevention Permits:** Talk to your Fire Prevention Bureau or Fire Department to make sure your space is meeting requirements, like working sprinklers, extinguishers and signage.
2. **Store Signage:** Speak to your local Zoning Office to make sure the signage your proposing is permitted, and the Buildings/Consutruction Department for the construction and build out of the sign.
3. **Construction Permits:** Check if you need a building/construction permit with your local government's Building Department before starting any renovations. [Find out if you need a construction permit](https://business.nj.gov/pages/building-permits-and-inspections).
4. **Certificate of Occupancy/Approval:** If you need a construction permit for your renovation, you may need to meet with the Buildings/Construction Department to obtain a `Certificate of Occupancy or Approval|certificate-occupancy` that indicates that your space is safe for occupancy. 
       
After you complete this task, you will know:
- What permits your local government requires
- What you need to do to meet those requirements and 
- How long it will take to get any permits or certificates
