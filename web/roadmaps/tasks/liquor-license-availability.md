Once you've found a site for your business, contact your local Clerk's office to verify the cost and availability of a liquor license in your area. Every local government has a unique process and cost associated with obtaining a liquor license. You will need to meet all requirements detailed in the [Alcoholic Beverage Control Handbook (ABC)](https://www.nj.gov/oag/abc/downloads/abchandbook02.pdf).

After you complete this task, you will have:
- met all requirements in the ABC Handbook
- learned about the availablity, cost, and timeline required to obtain a liquor license
