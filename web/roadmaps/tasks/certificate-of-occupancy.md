Now that you signed your lease, and determined site requirements, it's time to obtain approvals that show that your site is safe for visitors. Below is a checklist with some of the certificates or permits you may need.
      
1. **Fire Prevent Permits:** Obtain any fire prevention or burglar alarm permits from your local Fire Department.
2. **Sign Permits:** Obtain signage approvals from your local Building Department, Department of Community Affairs, or Zoning Office.
3. **Certificate of Occupancy/Approval:** If you've completed site renovations, it's time to obtain a `Certificate of Occupancy or Approval|Certificate-occupancy` from your local Buildings/Construction Department.

After you complete this step, you will have:
- Fire prevention and/or sign permits (if applicable)
- Certificate of Occupancy or Approval
