Your shop will need to have licensed staff. If the business owner does not have an individual license, the manager of the shop must have a license and at least 2 years of experience. It is the responsibility of shop owner to also ensure each staff member is appropriately licensed by the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs. Licenses are required for cosmetologists, hairstylists, manicurists, skin care specialists, barbers, hair braiders, beauticians, and teacher licenses. If staff do not already have a license, they can obtain a license by taking an exam with  the Division of Consumer Affairs.
