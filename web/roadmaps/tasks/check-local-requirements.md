Now that you signed your lease, it's time to obtain any local permits or certificates. Below are common local laws to consider obtaining.

1. **Mercantile License:** Check with your town Clerk if you need a mercantile license. Some cities and towns require this, it helps municipalities track businesses in the area.
2. **Additional actions for your industry:** Depending on the type of business you open, your town may require industry specific permits/licencing (e.g. Food Vendors and Gas Stations require licenses in Cherry Hill). Towns may also require additional inspections and guidance for your business, for example Restaurants often need to contact the local Fire Marshall, Health Department, and Sewer Department. *Check with your local Clerk, Zoning Officer, and Construction Official for more information.*

After you complete this task, you will have:
- Obtained all necessary local permits or licenses.
