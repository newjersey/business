The process for starting a new business varies for each city or town. But don’t worry, we’ve included a list of common tasks. Be sure to contact your local government to confirm requirements for your business.

### The following requirements are common in most towns and cities:

**Zoning Permits/Approval**: Be sure to check with your local zoning official to ensure your intended business use is permitted for your property.

**Renovation/Construction and Building Permits**: A Certificate of Occupancy is required by most townships. The certificate is issued after a local inspection to ensure the building meets the requirements for the business you intend to operate. If you plan to do construction, or change the use of your building, you may need a construction permit as well. Some municipalities may require a fire permit and burglar alarm system. *Check with your local Building Department.*

**Sign Permits**: Many towns require permits for permanent and temporary signs displayed outside your building. *Check with your local Building Department, Department of Community Affairs, or Zoning Office.*

**Mercantile License**: A mercantile license helps municipalities track businesses in their area. Not all municipalities will require a mercantile license. *Check with your town Clerk.*

**Additional actions for your industry**: Depending on the type of business you open, your town may require industry specific permits/licencing (e.g. Food Vendors and Gas Stations require licenses in Cherry Hill). Towns may also require additional inspections and guidance for your business, for example Restaurants often need to contact the local Fire Marshall, Health Department, and Sewer Department. *Check with your local Clerk, Zoning Officer, and Construction Official for more information.*

To complete this step, you need:
- A potential address for your business.
- Identify if you will be renovating or doing construction on the space.

After you complete this step, you will have:
- A list of local requirements that are specific to your business.
