Now that you signed your lease, and done research on local laws, it's time to obtain any local permits or certificates. Below is a checklist with some of the certificates or permits you may need.

1. **Zoning Permits/Approval:** If you changed the use of your site, make sure to obtain approval from your local Zoning Office.
2. **Fire Prevent Permits:** Work with your local Fire Department to obtain any approvals or permits for preventing a fire.
3. **Sign Permits:** If you put up new signage, you should need to obtain approval from your local Building Department, Department of Community Affairs, or Zoning Office.
4. **Building/Construction Permits:** A Certificate of Occupancy is required by most townships. The certificate is issued after a local inspection to ensure the building meets the requirements for the business you intend to operate. If you plan to do construction, or change the use of your building, you may need a construction permit as well. Some municipalities may require a fire permit and burglar alarm system. *Check with your local Building Department.*
5. **Mercantile License:** Check with your town Clerk if you need a mercantile license. Some cities and towns require this, it helps municipalities track businesses in their area.
6. **Additional actions for your industry**: Depending on the type of business you open, your town may require industry specific permits/licencing (e.g. Food Vendors and Gas Stations require licenses in Cherry Hill). Towns may also require additional inspections and guidance for your business, for example Restaurants often need to contact the local Fire Marshall, Health Department, and Sewer Department. *Check with your local Clerk, Zoning Officer, and Construction Official for more information.*

After you complete this task, you will have:
- A list of local requirements that are specific to your business.
